# Overview
This repository contains two high-quality datasets for bird species image classification using deep learning models. The datasets differ in scale and number of species, facilitating experimentation with different model architectures and techniques.

# Datasets:
# Birds 525 Species Dataset:

### Training Images: 84,635

### Test Images: 2,625 (5 images per species)

### Validation Images: 2,625 (5 images per species)

### Dataset Size: Large

Description: Comprehensive dataset with diverse bird species, meticulously cleaned and prepared to ensure no data leakage between training, test, and validation sets.

# Birds 20 Species Dataset:

###  Images: 3,208

### Test Images: 100 (5 images per species)

### Validation Images: 100 (5 images per species)

### Dataset Size: Small

## Description:
 Compact dataset focusing on a subset of bird species, also cleaned and prepared with no duplicate images.

# Models Implemented:
## Sequential Model:
### Description: 
Basic deep learning model where layers are added sequentially. Suitable for straightforward architectures and quick prototyping.
## VGG-16
### Description:
 A convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture known for its depth (16 layers) and uniform architecture (3x3 convolution filters with stride 1 and padding). Effective for image classification tasks but can be resource-intensive.

## VGG-19
### Description: 
Similar to VGG-16 but deeper (19 layers), offering potentially better performance at the cost of increased computational complexity and memory usage.

## MobileNet
### Description:
A lightweight CNN designed for mobile and embedded vision applications. It uses depthwise separable convolutions to reduce the number of parameters and computations while maintaining accuracy.
