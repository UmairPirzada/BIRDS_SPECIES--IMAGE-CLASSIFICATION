# BIRDS_SPECIES--IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION
Image Classification in Deep Learning: Image classification in deep learning involves teaching a model to recognize and categorize images into predefined classes.
# Bird Species Image Classification
# Overview
This repository contains two high-quality datasets for bird species image classification using deep learning models. The datasets differ in scale and number of species, facilitating experimentation with different model architectures and techniques.

# Datasets:
# Birds 525 Species Dataset:

Training Images: 84,635
Test Images: 2,625 (5 images per species)
Validation Images: 2,625 (5 images per species)
Dataset Size: Large
Description: Comprehensive dataset with diverse bird species, meticulously cleaned and prepared to ensure no data leakage between training, test, and validation sets.

# Birds 20 Species Dataset:

Training Images: 3,208
Test Images: 100 (5 images per species)
Validation Images: 100 (5 images per species)
Dataset Size: Small
Description: Compact dataset focusing on a subset of bird species, also cleaned and prepared with no duplicate images.
